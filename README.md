# <center>ft_printf - 42 School project</center>
## Description
This is a 42 school project where we are expected to replicate the behaviour of the printf function.
For this project we are supposed to handle the following cases:

+ %c Prints a single character.
+ %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
+ %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
+ %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
+ %i Prints an integer in base 10.
+ %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
+ %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
+ %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
+ %% Prints a percent sign.
